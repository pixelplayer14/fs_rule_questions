EV4.10.14 The TSAL’s green light voltage detection circuit, see EV4 .10.3, does not need to detect an
open circuit, as required by T11.9, when no voltage is present. A plausibility check against

input of the APPS.
EV4.11.7 After the TS has been activated, additional actions must be required by the driver to set the

EV5.6 Accumulator Isolation Relays
EV5.6.1 At least two AIRs must be fitted inside each TSAC.
EV5.6.2 The AIRs must open both poles of the TS accumulator. If the AIRs are open, no TS voltage
may be present outside of the TSAC and the vehicle side of the AIRs must be galvanically
isolated from the accumulator side, see EV1.2.1.
EV5.6.3 The AIRs must be mechanical relays of a “normally open” type.
EV5.7 Pre-Charge Circuit
EV5.7.1 A circuit that ensures that the voltage at the vehicle side of the AIRs is pre-charged to at
least 95 % of the actual TS accumulator voltage before closing the second AIR must be
implemented.
EV5.7.2 The pre-charge circuit must use a mechanical, normally open relay. All pre-charge current
must pass through this relay.
EV5.8 Accumulator Management System
EV5.8.1 Each TS accumulator must be monitored by an AMS whenever the LVS is active or the
accumulator is connected to a charger.
EV5.8.2 Every TSAC must contain its full AMS including its own and AMS exclusive SDC power
stage, see EV6.1
EV5.8.3 The AMS must continuously measure
• all cell voltages
• the TS current
• the temperature of thermally critical cells
•for lithium-based cells: the temperature of at least 30 % of the cells equally distributed
within the TSAC(s)
EV5.8.4 Cell temperature must be measured at the negative terminal of the respective cell. The
sensor used must be in direct contact with the electrically exposed negative terminal or
less than 10 mm along the high current path away from the terminal in direct contact with

the respective busbar. It is acceptable to monitor multiple cells with one sensor if this
requirement is met for all cells sensed by the sensor.
EV5.8.5 The maximum cell temperature is 60◦Cor the limit stated in the cell data sheet, whichever
is lower.
EV5.8.6 An independent cell temperature monitoring device may be provided by the officials during

The device must be placed on the warmest negative cell terminal of the TSAC and in direct
contact with the terminal or less than 30 mm away from it on the busbar.
EV5.8.7 The AMS must switch off the TS via the SDC, if a critical voltage, temperature, or current
value according to the cell manufacturer’s datasheet or these rules persistently occurs for
more than:
• 500 ms for voltage and current values
• 1 s for temperature values
The accuracy, noise, and sample rate of the measurement must be taken into account.
EV5.8.8 AMS cell voltage measurement inputs, temperature measurement inputs, and supply voltage
of decentralized AMS slaves may be rated below the maximum TS voltage if the team has
proven by calculations in the Electrical System Form (ESF), see EV9 , that the input voltage
rating is reasonably chosen.

even in bright sunlight and clearly marked with the lettering “AMS” must light up if and only
if the AMS opens the SDC. It must stay illuminated until the error state has been manually
reset, see EV6.1.6. Signals controlling this indicator are SCS, see T11.9.
EV5.8.10 AMS signals are System Critical Signals, see T11.9.
EV5.8.11 It must be possible to individually disconnect the current sensor, one temperature sensor, and
one cell voltage measurement wire during technical inspection if any wire is used.
EV5.8.12 The AMS must be able to read and display all measured values according to EV5 .8.3 in a
single overview e.g. by connecting a laptop to the AMS.
EV 6 S HUTDOWN CIRCUIT AND SYSTEMS
EV6.1 Shutdown Circuit
EV6.1.1 The Shutdown Circuit (SDC) directly carries the power driving the AIRs, see EV5 .6, and
the pre-charge circuitry, see EV5.7.
EV6.1.2 The SDC is defined as a series connection of at least two master switches, three shutdown
buttons, the BOTS, see T6.2, the IMD, the inertia switch, see T11.5, the BSPD, see T11.6,
all required interlocks, and the AMS.
An explanatory schematic of the required SDC, excluding any possible interlock circuitry, is
shown in Figure 22.

EV6.1.4 The Tractive System Master Switch (TSMS), see EV6 .2, must be the last switch before the
AIRs except for pre-charge circuitry and hardwired interlocks.
EV6.1.5 If the SDC is opened the TS must be shut down by opening all AIRs and the voltage in the
TS must drop to below 60 VDC and50 VACRMS in less than 5 s. All accumulator current
flow must stop immediately.
The action of opening the AIRs may be delayed by ≤250 ms to signal the action to the motor
controllers and reduce the TS current before the AIRs are opened. The AIR supply must be
abruptly switched off before reaching the minimum AIR supply voltage.
EV6.1.6 If the SDC is opened by the AMS or the IMD, it has to be latched open by a non-
programmable logic that can only be manually reset by a person at the vehicle who is
not the driver.
EV6.1.7 All circuits that are part of the SDC must be designed in a way, that in the de-energized/disconnected
state, they open the SDC.
EV6.1.8 It must be possible to demonstrate that all features of the SDC function correctly. This
includes all interlocks.
EV6.1.9 Every system that is required to or can open the SDC must have its own, non-programmable,
power stage to achieve this. The respective power stages must be designed to be able to carry
the SDC current, e.g. AIR inrush currents, and such that a failure cannot result in electrical
power being fed back into the electrical SDC.
EV6.1.10 The shutdown buttons, the BOTS, the TSMS, and all interlocks must not act through any
power stage.
EV6.1.11 All signals influencing the SDC are SCSs, see T11.9.

EV6.2 Tractive System Master Switch
EV6.2.1 An TSMS according to T11.2 must be part of the SDC, see EV6.1.2.
EV6.2.2 The TSMS must be fitted with a “lockout/tagout” capability to prevent accidental activation
of the TS. The ESO must ensure that it is locked in the off position whenever work is done
on the vehicle or no ESO is present.
EV6.2.3 The TSMS must be mounted in the middle of a completely orange circular area of ≥50 mm
diameter placed on a high contrast background.
EV6.2.4 The TSMS must be marked with “TS” and a symbol according to “ISO 7010-W012” (triangle
with a black lightning bolt on a yellow background).
EV6.3 Insulation Monitoring Device
EV6.3.1 Every vehicle must have an IMD installed in the TS system.
EV6.3.2 The IMD must be a Bender A-ISOMETER®iso-F1 IR155-3203 or -3204, or a Bender
ISOMETER®iso165C-1, or equivalent IMD approved for automotive use. Equivalency
may be approved by the officials based on the following criteria: robustness to vibration,
operating temperature range, IP rating, availability of a direct output, a self-test facility, and
must not be powered by the system that is monitored.
EV6.3.3 The response value of the IMD must be set to ≥500Ω/V, related to the maximum TS voltage.
EV6.3.4 The IMD must be connected on the vehicle side of the AIRs.
EV6.3.5 One IMD chassis ground measurement line must be connected to the grounded TSAC or the
respective grounded enclosure of the IMD. The other chassis ground measurement line must
be connected to the main hoop. Each connection must use a separate conductor, rated for at
least maximum TS voltage. An open circuit in any of these ground measurement connections
must result in an opened SDC.
EV6.3.6 In case of an insulation failure or an IMD failure, the IMD must open the SDC. This must
be done without the influence of any programmable logic. See also EV6 .1.6 regarding the
re-activation of the TS after an insulation fault.
EV6.3.7 A red indicator light in the cockpit that is easily visible from inside and outside the cockpit
even in bright sunlight and clearly marked with the lettering “IMD” must light up if and only
if the IMD opens the SDC. It must stay illuminated until the error state has been manually
reset, see EV6.1.6. Signals controlling this indicator are SCS, see T11.9.
